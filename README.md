## Goals

1. Create an index page that displays all the restaurants from the CSV file
2. Create a show page for each restaurant that shows the restaurant name, address, description, image, and url
3. On the index page, make sure that each restaurant name links to that restaurant's show page
4. Expand the form on the New Restaurant page to capture all information necessary to create a new restaurant
5. Add code such that submitting the form will successfully add the new restaurant to the CSV file and redirect you to your index page (or the show page for the new restaurant -- your choice!)
